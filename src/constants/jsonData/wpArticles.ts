        '\n<h2 id="h-significance-of-world-liver-day-2023">Significance of World Liver Day 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>World Liver Day is an annual global event observed on April 19th. The celebration intends to create awareness and highlights the significance of the second largest organ in the human body- the liver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year this dedicated day reminds us to learn more about the liver and take care of it in the long term. Likewise, this year I.e.2023, world liver day has a specific theme &#8211; “To stay alert about any liver issues, check liver health often through diagnosis and essential tests and that fatty liver can affect anybody” The theme emphasises the fact that fatty liver can happen to anyone, irrespective of diseases like diabetes, obesity and excess consumption of alcohol.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understanding the Liver</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a vital organ within the human body, the liver is responsible for many functions, including metabolism, digestion, immunity, filtration, and storing vitamins, minerals, and glucose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the functions mentioned earlier, the liver is also responsible for approximately 500 other physiological processes. Ongoing scientific research suggests there is still much to discover about this remarkable organ. Remarkably, the liver can regenerate itself even after extensive damage, with studies indicating it can restore function even after 60-70% damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, apart from these abilities, it might still be prone to damage. The liver is also the second most complex organ in the human body, without which the other tissues would not survive due to a lack of energy and nutrients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrating world liver day(WLD) intends to create awareness about liver health for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s begin with the types of liver disorders and how to control/treat them. Secondly, the useful tips and information for maintaining healthy liver.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Common liver diseases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liver diseases are characterised by damage to the liver, which prevents it from functioning normally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the fat accumulation in the liver in people who consume little alcohol. This causes scars and, finally, cirrhosis. Liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding are a few examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Hepatitis C</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hepatitis C is a viral infection that leads to fatigue, fever, muscle aches, and loss of appetite and causes liver inflammation. It is primarily spread through the transfusion of bodily fluids, hemodialysis, and needle-stick injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Hepatitis B</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This infection is characterised by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and jaundice and is caused by a viral infection. Fortunately, this infection can be easily prevented through the use of vaccines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Cirrhosis of liver</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of liver cells and scarring of the liver leads to cirrhosis and permanent loss of liver cells. Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are causes of cirrhosis. The symptoms of the disease are appetite loss, easy bruising and itching, yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and fatigue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Hepatitis A</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It passes from one person to another person through contaminated foods &amp; fluids, through sex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed various liver diseases, the next step is to explore how to provide the best care for this vital organ.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Want a healthy liver? Then follow these pointers.</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Recent findings state that <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no amount of alcohol is safe for health</a>. Limit alcohol consumption as alcohol consumption will lead to fluid accumulation and scarring of liver tissue. This causes the deadly disease “cirrhosis”.</li><li>Eat liver-healthy foods, and exercise regularly. This will help in maintaining a healthy weight. A healthy body will reduce the chances of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and “cirrhosis “.</li><li>The use of certain drugs and a few painkillers will harm the liver. Rationale use of these drugs will protect the liver from harmful effects.</li><li>Viral hepatitis disease in the liver is transferred through food and fluids. Opt for Vaccination to protect from viral hepatitis.</li><li>Avoid using razors, toothbrushes and needles to reduce the chances of transmission of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Also, contraceptives and latex protection while having sex and getting a vaccine are good ways to prevent hepatitis B.</li><li>Minimise or avoid exposure to pesticides and aerosol products, which are a potential cause of damage to the liver.</li><li>Avoid smoking, as the additives of cigarettes can harm the liver.</li><li>Stress can harm the liver too. Find ways to de-stress. Pick a hobby, and travel to relax. Do anything which relaxes the mind, body and soul.</li><li>Stay away from high-calorie foods and refined foods like white rice, white bread, and pasta. Instead, eat fibre-rich foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and cereals. These are the best foods to be included for a healthy liver.</li><li>Include monosaturated and polyunsaturated foods such as low-fat milk, cheese, nuts and seafood. These are a source of good fat for the human body.</li><li>Do not eat raw or uncooked shellfish.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a quote on the liver by William James,” Is life worth living? It all depends on the liver”. The liver’s primary role is removing toxins, processing food nutrients, and regulating body metabolism. As the liver carries these critical functions, it is imperative to take good care to keep it healthy. The most common liver disorders are fatty liver disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatitis A. Awareness of liver diseases will ensure the prevention and cure the liver diseases during their early stages. Observing a dedicated day 19th of April is to create awareness of liver health and implement measures through diet and exercises for a healthy liver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1681811722763"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Which colour is used to create awareness of the liver?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The colour green is used to signify awareness, advocacy and education concerning liver disease.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1681811840965"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How many days can you survive without a liver?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The liver can keep working even when a part of the liver is damaged or cut off.

        '\n<p>Purple Day aims to create a fact-based understanding of disease and eliminate unnecessary myths. Cassidy Megan gave birth to the purple day in 2008. Its purpose was to raise awareness about epilepsy. She began her journey of epilepsy awareness with positive encouragement from her personal life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme for purple epilepsy day 2023 is “stigma”, which is aimed at raising awareness about changing the perception of society on epilepsy through facts and clearing misunderstandings. Researchers on epilepsy believe “increasing the awareness for society including families, friends is critical for improving the lives of epilepsy people”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few basic and real things about epilepsy will be discussed in this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-is-epilepsy">What is epilepsy?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a neurological disorder characterised by the tendency of recurrent seizures. A seizure occurs due to unusual (abnormally high electrical activity) leading to disruption of normal function. It can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The diagnosis is confirmed based on the number of seizures. When two seizures, one after the other, or only one seizure with one possible seizure, are experienced, it confirms epilepsy. It is one of the common neurological disorders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-how-is-epilepsy-treated">How is epilepsy treated?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Treatment aims to balance achieving seizure control and avoiding undesirable effects due to drugs. The treatment is through anti-epileptic drugs. They work by controlling seizures; they do not cure or stop them. Anti-epileptic drugs should be taken daily, and the drug levels should be monitored, at least for some time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS involves the use of an implantable device to send a mild electric pulse to stimulate the vagus nerve, which will help with controlling focal seizures and depression) and a <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/keto-diet-overview-benefits-and-side-effects">ketogenic diet</a> (The diet is composed of extremely low carbohydrates, the idea is to use the fats stored in the body as the first source of energy than glucose or carbs) are other treatment and dietary measures to control seizures in epilepsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some helpful points to manage and control seizures are</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The patient should stick to the drug regimen tailored by a doctor, as poor medication adherence is the leading cause of seizures.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start="2"><li>Missed dosage should be promptly adjusted in the following dosage time.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start="3"><li>Always check with a doctor if you have to take other medications along with anti-epileptic. The drugs like aspirin and antibiotics should be taken with a doctor’s advice.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start="4"><li>Avoid excessive sleep deprivation, excessive alcohol, and drugs used for recreational purposes. Try to avoid these things altogether.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start="5"><li>Anti-epileptic drug therapy should be managed with the help of a physician in case of family planning.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start="6"><li>Finally, epilepsy patients should clearly understand that the doctor helps them with the drug therapy; the patient’s attitude makes a real difference.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The time and effort spent on understanding and treatment of epilepsy were successful. But people’s attitude towards it is still superstitious, and they believe epilepsy is due to witchcraft and curse. The outcome of such a dreadful situation is that people with epilepsy are separated from society and highly misunderstood. To end this, an event, a day dedicated to increasing awareness, educating, and providing a quality of life to epileptic patients, is obvious and appropriate, thus the purple day for epilepsy. Now, Let’s look at a few interesting facts which will create a better understanding of epilepsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-did-you-know-these-things-about-epilepsy">Did you know these things about epilepsy???</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 70 per cent of people with epilepsy can live a seizure-free life by taking epilepsy medications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest, 30% of people with epilepsy, are drug or medication-resistant. Such people can go for other additional treatments besides medications that can control or stop seizures entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epilepsy is not a contagious disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Injuries can happen during a seizure, but the patients do not harm themselves and do not have to visit a doctor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some very famous and successful people with epilepsy are the roman emperor Julius Caesar and the artist Vincent Van Gogh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more recent epilepsy patients with remarkable success are actor Danny Glover and singers Prince and Susan Boyle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epilepsy is not genetic. Anybody can be diagnosed with epilepsy at any point in life; epilepsy comes unannounced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epilepsy does not affect intelligence; it is consistent with that of healthy people. When the frequency and intensity of seizures rise, intelligence can be affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-prevention-of-epilepsy">Prevention of epilepsy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Epilepsy can be prevented by reducing the risks of head injuries and stroke. Use safety belts, airbags, helmets for the head, and safety seats for children while travelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final words&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purple epilepsy day is the day to get people together to learn about epilepsy. And, of course, extend the understanding to the society where people with epilepsy are treated without any discrimination. Learn more about epilepsy by reading and participating in any awareness event on this special and dedicated day. Just wear a simple purple ribbon to join the purple day. Let’s come together to understand epilepsy in the right sense and eradicate the bad and accept the good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1678960273796"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What does purple mean for epilepsy?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Cassidy used purple to represent lavender as it is considered the international flower of epilepsy.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1678960284453"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What exactly happens in epilepsy?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">A seizure will occur during epilepsy.

        '\n<p>Are you facing problems with sleep? Do you get enough sleep every night? Are you trying too hard to sleep but still failing? Do you wish to change your sleep pattern to get enough sleep?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us have not considered how we sleep, as a body&#8217;s natural cycle happens automatically. But we all experience nights when we find difficulty falling asleep even when we are tired or wake up multiple times in the middle of the night. We also experience nights when we stay conscious, even in sleep. The feeling gives us tired and unpleasant mornings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever given thought to why it happens? We could have scrolled some extra hours on Instagram or tried to finish the series the previous night which is interfering with sleep, or we ate something before bedtime that is playing around with our sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s time to kick off these habits and replace them with good ones that improve your sleep. Here are 7 common mistakes you must stop to <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/foods-for-better-sleep">improve your sleep</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-1-cease-your-screentime-before-bed">1. Cease your screentime before bed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that screen time before bed activates our brain, which leads to shorter sleep duration, poorer <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/foods-for-better-sleep">sleep quality</a>, and increased daytime sleepiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our smartphones, laptops, and tablets emit blue light, suppressing the production of melatonin, a sleep-regulating hormone. Melatonin is naturally produced by the body in response to darkness. Its levels rise in the evening to promote sleepiness at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screen cessation at least one to two hours before bed or use blue light blockers or filters on devices to reduce exposure to blue light. Alternatively, you can use Night shift mode on your phones, which will retain your melatonin levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Avoid Coffee or Alcohol before bedtime</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all experienced that caffeine and alcohol increase the frequency of waking up during the night when consumed before bedtime. The effects of caffeine can last for several hours, and close to bedtime, caffeine suppresses melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep. It also suppresses adenosine, a chemical released from the brain that <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/foods-for-better-sleep">promotes sleep</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While alcohol may temporarily make you weary and drowsy, it may also hinder you from getting into a deep sleep or Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep later in the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, you can enjoy your coffee for four to six hours and alcohol for at least two to three hours before bedtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Waking up at different times</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleeping and waking up at different times can also disrupt our sleep cycle. If you go to <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/an-ideal-bedtime-for-heart-health">bed at 9 p.m.</a> and wake up at 6 a.m., your body will adapt to this habit and you will end your sleeping hours at the same time every day. Consistent sleep comforts our body&#8217;s natural rhythm or internal clock and increases sleep efficiency. Try to stick to particular sleep times, even on weekends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Eating heavy meals before bedtime</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating a too-heavy or spicy meal before bedtime can cause indigestion and increase the metabolic rate because your body takes time to digest that food, which imbalances your sleep hormones. So avoid eating large meals at least two hours before bedtime. Instead, choose lighter, healthier snacks and eat portions that are easier to digest before sleeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Working out before bedtime</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No activity can induce better sleep than exercising. It is a great way to start the day, but it could be better before <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/how-many-hours-should-you-sleep">bedtime</a>. Exercise close to bedtime can make it harder for you to fall asleep. Exercising increases alertness and boosts your energy levels, preventing you from winding down and falling asleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, exercise increases body temperature, taking several hours to cool down. However, to fall asleep, our body temperature needs to drop slightly. If we exercise close to bedtime, our body may not have enough time to cool down, making it harder to fall asleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing the workout at least two to three hours before bedtime improves your sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Using your bed for activities other than sleep</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us watch TV, work, or use our phones in bed. These activities trick your brain into staying active and engaged while relaxing on the bed. Your brain finds it harder to associate your bed with sleep, leading to restless sleep. So keeping your bed exclusively for sleep and intimate activities is recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a separate workstation for other activities. It will train your brain to associate your bed with sleep and create a more conducive sleep environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Stressing about sleep</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing how vital sleep is for our health and routine activities, it is natural to feel stressed about getting enough sleep and ensuring that the quality of our sleep is good. As we do so, our brain becomes more active and engaged, which increases mental arousal. Our brain is still processing thoughts and <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/common-sleep-disorders">sleep-related stress</a>, making falling asleep harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relaxing with deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help eliminate stressful thoughts and induce sound sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By avoiding the above mistakes, you can create a better aura and improve the quality of your sleep. Besides, creating a bedtime ritual such as taking a warm bath, stretching, adjusting the lighting, lighting scented candles, and listening to audiobooks or reading will give you a satisfactory sleep. Other strategies that can help you with better sleep include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Avoiding drinking excess water before nighttime</li><li>Investing in comfortable bedding</li><li>If you are not a night shift employee, get enough bright light exposure during the day to synchronise your body&#8217;s sleep-wake cycle</li><li>Avoid oversleeping during the day</li><li>Include melatonin supplementation in your diet</li><li>Sip a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime to induce better sleep</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep is essential for repairing and regenerating tissues, consolidating memories, and regulating hormones. Insufficient sleep can impair our physical, mental, and emotional health, leading to various health problems. If you are having a consistent sleeping issue, get your sleep disorder diagnosed.

        '\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for information on piles and fissures, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. Piles and fissures are two types of anal disorders that are often confused. While both conditions can cause discomfort and pain, they are different in terms of their causes, symptoms, and treatments. Both piles and fissures can be treated with lifestyle changes, such as increasing fibre intake and staying hydrated, as well as with medication and surgery in more severe cases. It is essential to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms to determine the appropriate course of treatment. This article will discuss the key difference between piles and fissures so that you can understand these conditions better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-are-piles">What are Piles?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Piles, also known as <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/piles-hemorrhoids-symptoms-and-home-remedies">haemorrhoids</a>, are a condition where veins in the rectum and anus become swollen and inflamed. They are common and often caused by straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods, or other factors such as pregnancy.  Despite piles being a relatively common issue, many people are embarrassed to speak about them or seek medical attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-causes-of-piles">Causes of Piles&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/20-foods-that-help-you-poop-and-relieve-constipation">Constipation</a> and prolonged straining during bowel movements are critical factors in causing Piles.

Anal fissures can appear in people of any age; moreover, they are most commonly seen in children and people in the middle years of their lives.

It is usually caused by trauma to the area, such as passing hard stools or straining during bowel movements. In most cases, acute fissures heal on their own within a few weeks with proper treatment. However, if the fissure persists for more than eight weeks, it may become chronic and require further treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Chronic Fissure</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A chronic fissure is a small tear in the skin around the anus that has persisted for more than eight weeks and has not healed on its own. Chronic fissures can cause significant pain and discomfort, and may also result in itching, bleeding, and discharge. They are often caused by underlying conditions such as constipation or inflammatory bowel disease, and may require more aggressive treatment than acute fissures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-complications-of-anal-fissures">Complications of Anal fissures</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Chronic pain:</strong> If an anal fissure does not heal properly or is left untreated, it can cause chronic pain and discomfort, significantly impacting a person&#8217;s quality of life.</li><li><strong>Infection:</strong> If bacteria enters the anal fissure, it can cause an infection, which can be painful and require medical treatment.</li><li><strong>Abscess:</strong> An anal abscess can occur if bacteria infect the anal fissure and cause a collection of pus. It can be excruciating and may require surgical drainage.</li><li><strong>Fistula:</strong> An anal fistula can occur if an abscess does not heal properly and causes a tunnel between the anus and the surrounding skin. It can cause chronic pain and discomfort and may require surgical treatment.</li><li><strong>Incontinence:</strong> In rare cases, chronic anal fissures can lead to incontinence, which is the inability to control bowel movements.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-piles-vs-fissures">Piles vs Fissures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hemorrhoidal veins, or piles, are enlarged in the anus or lower rectum. Pain, itching, and bleeding during bowel movements are piles symptoms. Numerous things, such as constipation, pregnancy, or obesity, can contribute to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrarily, fissures are tiny tears in the skin near the anus. They may result from inflammatory bowel disease, persistent diarrhoea, or passing hard stools. Fissures can cause itching, discomfort, bleeding during bowel movements, and other symptoms like pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a difference between piles and fissures, according to the symptoms medications can be taken. Changes in diet and lifestyle, along with over-the-counter creams and ointments, are frequently used to treat piles. In addition to sitz baths and other natural remedies, creams or ointments can treat fissures. You might require surgery in some circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-treatment-of-piles-and-fissures">Treatment of Piles and Fissures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Piles and fissures are two common conditions that affect the anal area and can cause pain, discomfort, and bleeding. While these conditions may have different underlying causes, they share some common symptoms, and several medications can relieve the associated discomfort. Even though there is a difference between piles and fissures, there are a few medications that can be used to treat both.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here are some of the best medicine for piles and fissures:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Painkillers: </strong><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/painkiller-medicine-types-and-side-effect">Painkillers</a> such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help to relieve the pain associated with piles and fissures. However, these should be taken only under the guidance of a doctor, as they can have side effects and may interact with other medications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Topical creams and ointments: </strong><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/topical-pain-reliever-types">Topical creams</a> and ointments are available over-the-counter and can relieve the itching, burning, and pain associated with piles and fissures. They may contain ingredients such as lidocaine, hydrocortisone, or witch hazel, which can help to reduce inflammation and soothe the affected area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Suppositories:</strong> Suppositories are another option for treating piles and fissures. These small, round capsules inserted into the rectum contain medications such as hydrocortisone or zinc oxide, which can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain and itching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stool softeners:</strong> Stool softeners help relieve constipation by making it easier to pass stool. They draw water into the bowel to soften the stool, making it easier to pass. Stool softeners are available in oral capsules, tablets, and liquids. Docusate sodium, Polyethylene glycol (Miralax), Mineral oil, and Lubricant laxatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nitroglycerin ointment:</strong> Nitroglycerin ointment is a medication that can help relax the sphincter muscle and improve blood flow to the anal area, promoting the healing of fissures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-best-ayurvedic-medicine-for-piles-and-fissures-natural-and-effective-remedies">Best Ayurvedic Medicine for Piles and Fissures – Natural and Effective Remedies:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Triphala </strong>is a potent Ayurvedic remedy for piles and fissures.

        '\n<h2 id="h-what-is-melasma">What is Melasma?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Melasma is a skin condition that results in dark spots on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and neck <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/natural-pregnancy-acne-remedies">pigmentation during pregnancy</a>. It is commonly called a &#8220;pregnancy mask&#8221; because it occurs in many women during pregnancy, although it can also affect men and non-pregnant women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melasma is not a dangerous condition, but it can be distressing for those affected by it. In some cases, melasma may fade after pregnancy, but in others, it may persist. Fortunately, several treatment options are available, including topical lightening agents, chemical peels, and laser therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-causes-of-melasma-during-pregnancy">Causes of Melasma during Pregnancy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact cause of <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/skin-pigmentation-overview-causes-and-natural-home-remedies">skin pigmentation</a> during pregnancy is not entirely known. Still, it is thought to be related to several factors, which include hormonal changes, genetics, and sun exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-1-hormonal-changes">1. Hormonal Changes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pregnancy is associated with a significant hormone increase, particularly estrogen and progesterone. These hormones stimulate the production of melanin, the pigment that gives colour to the skin, leading to the development of melasma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-2-sun-exposure">2. Sun Exposure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sun exposure can worsen melasma by stimulating melanin production. Ultraviolet (UV) light can penetrate the skin and increase melanin production, resulting in dark patches or pigmentation during pregnancy on the skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other risk factors that can increase the chances of developing melasma during pregnancy include a history of hormonal imbalances, certain medications, and a personal or family history of the condition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to a doctor for a proper diagnosis and discussing the best treatment for your situation is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-3-genetics">3. Genetics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Melasma has a vital genetic component; some people may be more susceptible to developing the condition due to their genetic makeup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-symptoms-of-melasma">Symptoms of Melasma&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary symptom of melasma is dark, irregularly-shaped patches on the face. These patches are typically symmetrical and may appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. The colour of the patches can range from light brown to dark brown and may be lighter or darker than the surrounding skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patches may sometimes have a slightly raised or rough texture, and the skin may feel itchy or have a mild burning sensation. However, these symptoms are not typical, and melasma is usually painless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is essential to know that not all dark patches on the face are melasma. Other conditions, such as age spots, freckles, or sunburn, can also cause dark patches on the skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-diagnosing-melasma-during-pregnancy">Diagnosing Melasma during Pregnancy</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Examining the Skin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The diagnosis of melasma during pregnancy usually begins with a physical examination of the skin. A doctor may examine pigmentation during pregnancy or the dark patches and ask about any symptoms or triggers, such as sun exposure or hormonal changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The doctor may also ask about family history and current medications, which can provide additional information that may help with the diagnosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to a physical examination, the doctor may use a unique tool called a Wood lamp to examine the skin. The Wood&#8217;s lamp emits ultraviolet light, which can help the doctor determine the depth and extent of the pigmentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Performing a Skin Biopsy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, a skin biopsy may be required to determine other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. During a skin biopsy, a small skin sample is taken and examined under a microscope to determine the cause of the dark patches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-treatments-for-melasma-during-pregnancy">Treatments for Melasma during Pregnancy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some best products for Melasma are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Sunscreen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing a wide-brimmed hat and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF concentration can help prevent the worsening of melasma and protect the skin from UV damage. Majorly it helps to avoid face pigmentation during pregnancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Topical Lightening agents</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydroquinone is a commonly used topical lightening agent, but it is not recommended during pregnancy. Your doctor may prescribe a topical cream that contains azelaic acid, kojic acid, or glycolic acid. These ingredients can help to lighten the dark patches of melasma. It may be safe during pregnancy and can help to treat melasma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Chemical peels</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Chemical peels, which include glycolic acid or salicylic acid peels, can help lighten the dark patches caused by melasma. However, discussing chemical peels with a doctor is essential, as some peels may not be safe during pregnancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Laser therapy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your doctor will use a laser to target the dark patches of melasma, which will break up the pigment. It will cause the dark patches to fade over time. Laser therapy is not typically recommended during pregnancy because it is unclear how it might affect a developing foetus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-how-to-avoid-melasma-during-pregnancy">How to avoid Melasma during pregnancy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might not be possible to prevent melasma completely, but several steps can help minimise the risk of developing melasma or pigmentation during pregnancy. They are</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Avoid sun exposure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid sun exposure, especially during peak hours like(10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), when the sun is strongest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Wear protective clothing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When spending time outside, dress protectively in long-sleeved shirts and pants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Avoid hormonal changes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hormonal changes, which occur during pregnancy, can trigger melasma. If possible, talk to a doctor about ways to <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/hormones-in-body-overview-types-functions">manage hormonal changes</a>, such as taking hormonal contraceptives. This may help to avoid pigmentation during pregnancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Avoid irritants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid skin irritants like hot water and harsh soaps that can cause or exacerbate melasma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Maintain a healthy diet.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A healthy diet rich in minerals and vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, can help maintain healthy skin and reduce the risk of developing melasma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that melasma is complex, and there is no definitive way to prevent it. However, by following these tips, it may be possible to reduce the risk of developing melasma or prevent it from worsening.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-home-remedies-for-melasma">Home remedies for Melasma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Home remedies for pigmentation during pregnancy are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aloe Vera </strong>is a natural ingredient used for centuries to treat skin conditions.

        '\n<h2 id="h-what-is-mitral-valve-prolapse">What is Mitral Valve Prolapse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitral valve prolapse is a very common heart valve abnormality. It is also known as &#8220;click murmur syndrome&#8221; and &#8220;Barlow&#8217;s syndrome&#8221;. Women are more susceptible to this condition than men. A normal mitral valve is composed of two thin leaflets that are located between the heart&#8217;s left atrium and left ventricle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During mitral valve prolapse, as the heart muscles contract during each beat, the lids (leaflets) of the heart&#8217;s mitral valve bump (prolapse) like a parachute into the heart&#8217;s left upper chamber (left atrium). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click-murmur syndrome is yet another term for mitral valve prolapses. When a physician uses a stethoscope to listen to your heart, they may hear a clicking sound as the valve leaflets droop back, preceded by a whooshing sound (murmur) as blood flows back into the atrium.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-causes-mitral-valve-prolapse">What causes Mitral Valve Prolapse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitral prolapses occur when the mitral valve tissues are abnormally large or damaged, causing the valve to slip backwards. The mitral valve prolapse causes are unknown in the majority of cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prolapse of the mitral valve can run in families. Conditions that cause aberrant cartilage might also cause it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitral valve prolapse is more prevalent in women between 20 and 40, but it can also affect men. Although the exact mitral valve prolapses cause is unknown, it has a strong hereditary tendency. Family members who are affected are typically tall, thin, and have long arms and fingers, as well as straight backs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-are-the-symptoms-of-mitral-valve-prolapse">What are the symptoms of Mitral Valve Prolapse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitral valve prolapse is a lifelong health condition that may be asymptomatic. However, when blood leaks backwards, you can experience mitral valve prolapse symptoms due to mitral valve regurgitation. The signs can be different and show up over a long time. They might be</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> The most common symptom is <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/chest-pain-while-coughing">chest pain</a>. Although chest pain is annoying and frightening, it does not significantly raise the risk of a <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/natural-home-remedies-for-heart-attack-prevention">heart attack</a>, death, or other heart problems.</li><li><strong>Palpitations:</strong> Palpitations are heartbeat manifestations that are fast or irregular. It is usually harmless in people with mitral valve prolapse. Palpitations may be caused by potentially severe heart rhythm abnormalities that require further diagnosis and management.</li><li><strong>Anxiety, Depression, and Panic Attacks:</strong> Mitral valve prolapse has been linked to <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/reduce-anxiety-by-mindfulness-tricks">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/panic-attack-symptoms-and-causes">panic attacks</a>, and depression. These symptoms, like fatigue, are thought to be connected to autonomic nervous system imbalances.</li><li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Although the cause of <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-and-its-treatment">fatigue</a> is unknown, it is the most common symptom of mitral valve prolapse. In people with mitral valve prolapse, the autonomic nervous system, which controls heart rate and breathing, gets disrupted. These imbalances may result in insufficient blood oxygen transfer to the working muscles, resulting in fatigue.</li><li><strong>Pulmonary oedema:</strong> Pulmonary oedema occurs when fluid from the lungs&#8217; blood vessels leaks into the lung tissue, causing swelling.</li><li><strong>Migraine Headaches:</strong> Mitral valve prolapse has been linked to migraine headaches. <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/pre-migraine-symptoms-when-to-call-a-doctor">Migraines</a> are most likely caused by a malfunction in the nervous system&#8217;s control of blood vessel tension in the brain.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-are-the-complications-associated-with-mitral-valve-prolapses">What are the Complications associated with Mitral Valve Prolapses?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though most people with mitral prolapses have no problems, complications can occur. Mitral valve regurgitation is one of them. The most common complication is when the valve leaks blood back into the left atrium. Mitral valve regurgitation is more likely if you&#8217;re a man or have high blood pressure. To avoid heart failure, you may need surgery to repair or replace the valve if regurgitation is severe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-1-problems-with-heart-rhythm-arrhythmias">1. Problems with heart rhythm (arrhythmias)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Irregular heart rhythms are most common in the heart&#8217;s upper chambers. They can be inconvenient, but they are rarely life-threatening. Those with severe mitral valve regurgitation or deformity are at a greater risk of developing rhythm problems, which can impair blood flow through the heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-2-infection-of-the-heart-valves-endocarditis">2. Infection of the heart valves (endocarditis)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The endocardium is a thin lining on the inner side of the heart chambers. An abnormal mitral valve increases the risk of bacterial infection in the inner lining of the heart, which further damages the mitral valve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-are-the-diagnosis-methods-for-mitral-valve-prolapse">What are the diagnosis methods for Mitral Valve Prolapse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before determining a diagnosis, your doctor will usually do several tests to understand more about your heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time, your doctor will first notice Mitral Valve Prolapse when they detect a heart murmur or other abnormal sound with a stethoscope.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other tests used to diagnose Mitral Valve Prolapse include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Echocardiography</li><li>Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a type of echocardiography that uses sound waves</li><li>Catheterization of the Heart (Cardiac Cath or angiogram)</li><li>Scans for radionuclides</li><li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-are-the-treatment-options-for-mitral-valve-prolapse">What are the treatment options for Mitral Valve Prolapse?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people have no mitral valve prolapse symptoms, so<strong> </strong>treatment<strong> </strong>is rarely required. But if you have noticeable symptoms, your doctor may decide to treat you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medications are often used as part of the treatment to help relieve symptoms. Some of the drugs your doctor might give you are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Aspirin to prevent clots</li><li>Beta-blockers to regulate heartbeat and blood flow</li><li>Anti-clotting drugs</li><li>Vasodilators to increase blood flow</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Surgery is done for severe regurgitation or heart failure. If the valve is not repaired, it is replaced with a mechanical or biological valve manufactured from cow, pig, or human tissue. Before the treatment, your doctor will review the advantages and disadvantages of both valves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-preventive-measure-for-mitral-valve-prolapse">What is the best preventive measure for mitral valve prolapse?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitral regurgitation can cause heart failure, enlargement, and abnormal rhythms in patients with mitral valve prolapse. This is why patients with mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation are recommended to get frequently evaluated on an annual basis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people who suffer from mitral valve prolapse have a good prognosis and do not require mitral valve prolapse treatment. Routine examinations, including echocardiograms every few years, are the best preventive measure for people dealing with mitral valve prolapse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your generic and branded medicines for heart by uploading your prescription on Truemeds and avail yourself of a free teleconsultation from our expert doctors on our online pharmacy – <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_campaign=Sok_Search_Brand&amp;adgroupid=128411669733&amp;utm_term=truemeds&amp;utm_adid=%7Badid%7D&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbqdBhDvARIsAGYnXBMUEJ8U8dXBZCauCcv7I67U4f6cLk8FVkcUVvoujVT2BEv6I8YunXsaAjIMEALw_wcB">Truemeds</a>.

        '\n<h2 id="h-what-is-a-pilonidal-cyst">What is a pilonidal cyst?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a tissue sac with fluid or air in it. This is also known as pilonidal sinus, intergluteal pilonidal disease, or simply pilonidal cysts. In simple terms, they are benign skin growths that develop in the buttock crease. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few people develop pilonidal cysts yearly, making it a common condition. Often, people are not comfortable discussing it openly, even not with their doctors. A few treatments for it include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Cyst drainage.&nbsp;</li><li>Injections.&nbsp;</li><li>Antibiotics.&nbsp;</li><li>Laser treatment.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is painful and frequently requires hospital treatment. One may suffer from an acute episode of pilonidal cysts or develop chronic pilonidal cysts that reappear over time. Chronic pilonidal cysts may also cause sinus cavities and abscesses and swelling pockets of infection when left untreated (empty spaces underneath the skin).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was earlier known as &#8220;Jeep driver&#8217;s disease&#8221; because they are more prevalent among those who spend a lot of time sitting. A pilonidal infection results in severe pain, especially when seated. Ingrown hairs are a common symptom, which eventually leads to these cysts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-symptoms-of-pilonidal-cyst">Symptoms of Pilonidal cyst:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A bulge or an opening in the skin (sinus tract) in the sacrococcygeal area is the only sign of pilonidal disease in some people. When an infection spreads to the cyst, the following pilonidal cyst symptoms appear:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A pit at the top of the buttocks crease</li><li>Pain</li><li><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/role-of-diet-in-skin-inflammation">Skin inflammation</a> and swelling</li><li>Leakage of pus or blood from a wound on the skin</li><li>A smell caused by pus drainage</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-causes-of-pilonidal-cyst">Causes of Pilonidal cyst:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A specific cause is unknown. However, studies reveal that it is the result of a combination of shifting hormones with age. As it develops after puberty, there is hair growth, friction from clothes, and prolonged sitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friction-inducing activities, such as sitting, cause the hair in that region to regress beneath the skin. Consequently, cysts develop around the hair because of an immunological reaction. In rare cases, people&#8217;s sinuses may attach under the skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-risk-factors-for-pilonidal-cyst">Risk factors for Pilonidal cyst</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The chance of developing a pilonidal cyst may be affected by the following</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Presenting as a young adult white male.</li><li>Excessive weight</li><li>A lack of physical activity</li><li>Spending a lot of time sitting</li><li>A body covered with dense, stiff hair</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-diagnosis-of-pilonidal-cyst">Diagnosis of Pilonidal cyst</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is identified by combining the patient&#8217;s responses to the doctor&#8217;s questions and a physical examination. Examples of queries a doctor may ask you include</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When did the symptoms start to appear?</li><li>Have you ever had this problem?</li><li>Have you been sick with a fever?</li><li>What medicines or supplements do you take?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-treatment-of-pilonidal-cyst">Treatment of Pilonidal cyst</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to opt for surgery depends on the severity of your symptoms. There are many other additional treatment options available, including the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Cyst drainage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This surgery may be at the surgeon&#8217;s place. An infected cyst is removed with a tiny incision (cut) to allow the fluid to be drained from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Injections</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Mild to severe pilonidal cysts may be treated and prevented using phenol injections, an acidic chemical molecule.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Antibiotics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Antibiotics are an effective treatment for inflammation of the skin. However, antibiotics cannot heal pilonidal cysts on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Laser treatment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to prevent recurring pilonidal cyst formation by treating ingrown hairs with laser treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To relieve pain while receiving treatment, apply a warm compress to the sore region to calm your skin. A comfortable inflatable mattress or chair is an excellent supporting technique during treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-prevention-of-pilonidal-cyst">Prevention of Pilonidal cyst:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the steps required to prevent the occurrence and recurrence of pilonidal cysts. A few steps to take care of the it are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cleaning and drying your buttocks regularly (to keep the area clean).</li><li>Reduce risk by losing weight&nbsp;</li><li>If possible, take frequent breaks from sitting to relieve any stress in the region</li><li>Shave the hair that is surrounding your buttocks (once a week or more)</li><li>Use a hair removal product to further reduce the risk of developing ingrown hairs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not life-threatening, but it may become chronic and difficult to treat if you take too long to get medical attention. For this reason, if you have any of the symptoms of a pilonidal cyst, you should immediately consult a doctor. Tell your doctor about every problem or symptom you&#8217;ve started experiencing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your doctor may advise using allopathic medications if you&#8217;ve tried these methods lacking effect and they still aren&#8217;t alleviating your pilonidal cyst symptoms. You may pick up the medicine your doctor ordered for you at any local drugstore. Otherwise, you may switch to an <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/">online pharmacy</a> service like Truemeds if you want home delivery, lucrative discounts,&nbsp; and definitely regular savings on your bill. Truemeds is an online pharmacy that offers substantial discounts (up to 72%) and doorstep delivery on all prescription medicine orders placed by its customers.</p>\n',

        '\n<p>Being mindful means slowing down and appreciating the little moments we often ignore. The mind needs to be calmed by giving attention to the body. Incorporate brief periods of mindfulness throughout the day using all these strategies to reduce stress and find mental peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-1-think-of-what-you-want-to-accomplish-and-aim-for-it">1. Think of what you want to accomplish and aim for it.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting an objective can help you stay focused and remind you why you are doing something. You can do this in your morning journal or before a significant task. If you&#8217;re nervous about giving a presentation at work, aim to help you get through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-2-start-meditating-or-practising-mindfulness-with-a-guided-session">2. Start meditating or practising mindfulness with a guided session.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a spare moment and a suitable app is required to begin meditating. There is no better way to start a new hobby or skill than with the help of an app or an online program. There are various free, professionally guided meditations available on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Read more- </strong><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/stress-free-solutions-natural-remedies-to-overcome-anxiety">Stress-Free Solutions: 10 Natural Remedies to Overcome Anxiety</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-3-use-your-creativity-to-colour">3. Use your creativity to colour.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow yourself time to be creative. You&#8217;ll be able to express creativity while also resting your mind. Do you find drawing difficult? Buy a colouring book, whether you&#8217;re an adult or not. You&#8217;ll benefit from feeling accomplished.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-4-get-outside-and-walk-around">4. Get outside and walk around.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just going outside and walking around can do wonders for relieving stress. Begin by strolling around the block to gauge your level of motivation. Listen to the birds chirping, feel the breeze, inhale deeply, and inhale the aromas. Put your phone away (or, better yet, leave it at home) and immerse yourself in the experience by tuning into your senses and the world around you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-5-sending-positive-thoughts-and-prayers-to-others">5. Sending positive thoughts and prayers to others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The author and early Googler Chade-Meng Tan suggest a simple exercise that may be completed in under a minute. Make spontaneous wishes for other people&#8217;s happiness throughout the day. You can set the tone of encouragement without telling the person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meng&#8217;s ideas may have merit, as she has been nominated for eight Nobel Peace Prizes. Get some practice on your way to and from work, at the gym, or while waiting in a queue. If someone annoys or upsets you about someone, try to pull yourself together and (mentally) wish them happiness instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-6-look-at-the-sky">6. Look at the sky</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should look at the stars and the screen in front of you. Whether taking out the garbage or arriving home late, take a few deep breaths and gaze at the stars. Allow the universe to remind you that there is more to life than your problems and inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-7-give-it-some-thought">7. Give it some thought.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making tea is an essential task. Set up a place to practice and focus on each step. How do the leaves smell when you pull them off? What does the water look like before the tea is added? Watch the steam rise from the cup and feel the warmth of the cup on your hand. If you have time, sip your tea without getting too busy. Don&#8217;t like tea? You can easily do this while making rich, good-smelling French-pressed coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-8-pay-attention-to-one-thing-at-a-time">8. Pay attention to one thing at a time.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If used correctly, your to-do list can be a form of mindfulness. Give one task your complete and undivided attention for five minutes—no multitasking, including checking your phone, clicking notifications, or browsing the internet. Allow that one task to take centre stage until the timer goes off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-9-leave-your-phone">9. Leave your phone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bathroom, take a minute for yourself and your needs. Take a moment to sit and breathe before eating. When you use the restroom, Place your cell phone in another room.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-10-relax-your-mind-while-you-do-housework">10. Relax your mind while you do housework.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop worrying about your to-do list or the mess around you, and just enjoy the moment. You can dance while you do the dishes or watch the soap run down the tiles while you clean the shower. While waiting for the microwave to stop, take five slow breaths.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-11-scribbling-your-thoughts">11. Scribbling your thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no correct way to keep a journal. Putting pen to paper, whether structured or scribbled on a random scrap, can help calm the mind and control chaotic thoughts. Try keeping a gratitude journal or simply jotting down the three finest events of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-12-stop-at-red-lights">12. Stop at red lights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite popular belief, you can only time travel or move vehicles when you&#8217;re on time. At stop lights, concentrate instead of hurrying. Take four slow, deep breaths while waiting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-13-disconnecting-from-social-media">13. Disconnecting from social media</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Social networking can increase anxiety and decrease productivity. It&#8217;s surprising how often you need to think before you check social media. Logout. Retyping a password slows or stops you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-14-take-a-look">14. Take a look</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Actively attempting to be present in every moment might increase worry and tension. Recognise when you need to relax and then let your thoughts go wherever it wants to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any amount of mindfulness is beneficial. The most important thing is to maintain regular mindfulness practice. Regular mindfulness practice can assist you in calming your mind and overcoming unfavourable feelings. At least five minutes daily for self-reflection and a relaxing meditation or mindfulness practice.

        '\n<h2 id="h-what-happens-during-numb-feelings">What happens during numb feelings?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A tingling sensation usually accompanies numbness. Unlike temporary numbness, numbness that lasts for a prolonged duration indicates serious health problems. This symptom may be temporary due to sitting on legs or staying in the same position for a long time. Diseases such as <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/diabetes-types-symptoms-prevention">Diabetes</a>, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and peripheral <a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/cardiovascular-disease-signs-and-symptoms-of-an-unhealthy-heart">artery disease</a> can cause tingling in the legs and feet that lasts for a long time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The numbness can be felt in different leg parts, such as below the knee and whole feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numbness in the legs could be a temporary problem or a sign of other health problems. The symptoms get worse over time. The patient might initially lose sensation in their feet, which may eventually affect the entire leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lack or reduced flow of blood causes numbness and damages the nerves. Numbness in the feet can also be due to inflammation, infection, trauma, or any abnormal process inside the body.&nbsp; However, the good part is that most conditions that cause numbness in the legs are not life-threatening. It may lead to tremors and strokes, though.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numbness of feet is due to nerve damage. The feet are numb, with no pain or sensation of pricking or burning.&nbsp; It is common for leg numbness to get worse at night. This condition is called paraesthesia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-symptoms-for-numbness-in-the-leg">Symptoms for Numbness in the Leg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Numbness is just a single symptom that a person will feel and express. But different people will feel a mix of signs and symptoms. The other signs &amp; symptoms are</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Itching</li><li>Tingling</li><li>Tickling</li><li>Burning</li><li>Crawling sensation under the skin</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-causes-of-leg-numbness">Causes Of Leg Numbness&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting in the wrong posture and standing for longer times can cause numbness in the leg. If there is a tingling feeling and numbness for a long time or all the time, it could be signalling more than just numbness. Several leg numbness causes due to:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Posture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad posture habits can cause numbness. Postures like crossing legs for too long, kneeling or sitting for long durations, and wearing tight socks, shoes, or pants lead to numb feelings.  With bad standing or sitting, posture can pressure nerves or cause poor leg blood flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.&nbsp;Lower back issues</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/10-natural-remedies-for-lower-back-pain-treatment-at-home">Pain in the lower back</a>, herniated disc or a broken spinal disc exerts pressure on nerves. In the sciatica condition, the sciatic nerve is irritated, leading to tingling and numb feeling in the legs and feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Peripheral artery disease</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a condition when the flow of blood to arms, legs and abdomen is reduced. Ultimately, it leads to numbness, soreness, or cramping while walking or climbing stairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Intake of alcohol</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.truemeds.in/blog/7-tips-to-overcome-alcohol-addiction">Heavy drinkers</a> suffer from nerve damage in their feet and legs, making them numb. This damage is also linked to decreased levels of essential vitamins like B12, B1, and B9.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Diabetes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In diabetic neuropathy, patients feel a tingling sensation in the foot and leg and numbness and pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Injury&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Injuries to the ankle, foot, hip, spine, leg, and torso exert pressure on nerves, leading to numbness in the feet and legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Other Health Problems&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Other conditions that cause numbness in the feet and legs are abnormal growths, tumours, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-treatment-for-numbness-in-feet">Treatment for numbness in feet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Treatment for numbness in the feet and legs depends on the cause or reason behind the numb feeling. If the numbness in the leg is painful, lasts for a long time, or occurs frequently, you must consult a doctor. Otherwise, follow these home remedies for relief.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are a few treatment options you can try at home to ease the discomfort:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Apply an ice pack</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ice can help reduce swelling. Apply cold packs or cold compresses on numb legs and feet for 15 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Exercise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lack of activity reduces blood flow to the lower limbs. Yoga, Pilates, and tai chi improve blood flow and relieve chronic pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Rest</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Too much stress on the legs may also lead to numbness. Adequate rest can relieve numbness and pain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Massage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Massaging numb legs and feet can resume blood flow and ease the pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Epsom salt baths</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Epsom salts contain magnesium &#8211; a compound that helps improve blood flow and circulation</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Applying heat&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Heat can help release stiff, painful, or strained muscles that push on nerves and create numbness.&nbsp; However, warming numb legs and feet aggravates inflammation and induces discomfort and numbness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting or standing too long, neurological injury/disease, and chronic health disorders like multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia can cause leg numbness or tingling (chronic &amp; widespread pain). If the home remedies do not help and leg and foot numbness or tingling sensation continues, then consult the doctor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After consulting with your doctor, refer to our Truemeds Physicians, which provides free online consultations.
