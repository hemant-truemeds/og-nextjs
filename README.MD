## Why we need nextJs and typescript:-

Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications. TypeScript, on the other hand, is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type checking and other features to the language. Combining Next.js with TypeScript can bring several benefits:

# Features of NextJs:-

1. Server-side rendering: Next.js enables server-side rendering of React components, which improves the performance and SEO of web applications.
2. Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits the JavaScript code into smaller chunks and serves only the required code to the user, which results in faster page loads.
3. Static site generation: Next.js supports static site generation, which enables developers to pre-render pages at build time, resulting in fast loading times and improved SEO.
4. Image optimization: Next.js optimizes images by reducing their size and quality, resulting in faster load times and improved user experience.
5. CSS modules: Next.js provides built-in support for CSS modules, which enables developers to write modular and reusable CSS code.
6. Fast Refresh: Next.js comes with Fast Refresh, which enables developers to see changes in their code immediately, without having to reload the page.
7. TypeScript support: Next.js provides built-in support for TypeScript, which enables developers to write type-safe React applications.
8. Middleware support: Next.js supports middleware, which enables developers to add custom functionality to the server-side rendering process

# Features of Typescript:-

1. Type safety: TypeScript allows developers to catch type-related errors before they happen at runtime, making code more reliable and easier to maintain. Next.js supports TypeScript out of the box, making it easy to use TypeScript in our Next.js projects.
2. Better IDE support: TypeScript provides better code completion, refactoring, and error highlighting in modern code editors, which can help developers write better code more efficiently. This is especially useful in large projects where it can be hard to keep track of all the moving parts.
3. Improved scalability: TypeScript can help improve the scalability of our Next.js projects by providing better code organization, easier maintainability, and more predictable behavior.
4. Faster development: TypeScript can help reduce the time it takes to develop and debug code by providing better tooling and more accurate type information.
   In summary, combining Next.js with TypeScript can bring several benefits that can help improve the quality, scalability, and maintainability of our web applications.
